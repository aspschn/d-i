  <sect2 arch="arm"><title>Three different ARM ports</title>

<para>
The ARM architecture has evolved over time and modern ARM processors
provide features which are not available in older models.  &debian;
therefore provides three ARM ports to give the best support for a very
wide range of different machines:

    &debian;/armel targets older 32-bit ARM processors without support
    for a hardware floating point unit (FPU),
  </para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>
    &debian;/armhf works only on newer 32-bit ARM processors which
    implement at least the ARMv7 architecture with version 3 of the
    ARM vector floating point specification (VFPv3). It makes use of
    the extended features and performance enhancements available on
    these models.

  <listitem><para>
    &debian;/arm64 works on 64-bit ARM processors which implement at
    least the ARMv8 architecture.
  </para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
Technically, all currently available ARM CPUs can be run in either
endian mode (big or little), but in practice the vast majority use
little-endian mode. All of &debian;/arm64, &debian;/armhf and
&debian;/armel support only little-endian systems.
</para>

  <sect2 arch="arm"><title>Variations in ARM CPU designs and support complexity</title>

<para>
ARM systems are much more heterogeneous than those based on the
i386/amd64-based PC architecture, so the support situation can be much
more complicated.
</para>

<para arch="armel;armhf">
The ARM architecture is used mainly in so-called
<quote>system-on-chip</quote> (SoC) designs. These SoCs are designed
by many different companies with vastly varying hardware components
even for the very basic functionality required to bring the system
up. System firmware interfaces have been increasingly standardised
over time, but especially on older hardware firmware/boot interfaces
vary a great deal, so on these systems the Linux kernel has to take
care of many system-specific low-level issues which would be handled
by the mainboard's BIOS in the PC world.
</para>

<para arch="armel;armhf">
At the beginning of the ARM support in the Linux kernel, the hardware
variety resulted in the requirement of having a separate kernel for
each ARM system in contrast to the <quote>one-fits-all</quote> kernel
for PC systems.  As this approach does not scale to a large number of
different systems, work was done to allow booting with a single ARM
kernel that can run on different ARM systems.  Support for newer ARM
systems is now implemented in a way that allows the use of such a
multiplatform kernel, but for several older systems a separate
specific kernel is still required. Because of this, the standard
&debian; distribution only supports installation on a selected number
of such older ARM systems, alongside the newer systems which are
supported by the ARM multiplatform kernels (called <quote>armmp</quote>) in
&debian;/armhf.

<para arch="arm64">
The ARM architecture is used mainly in so-called
<quote>system-on-chip</quote> (SoC) designs. These SoCs are designed
by many different companies, often with vastly varying hardware
components even for the very basic functionality required to bring the

differences from one SoC to the next, but ARMv8 (arm64) is much more
standardised and so is easier for the Linux kernel and other software
to support.
</para>

<para arch="arm64">
Server versions of ARMv8 hardware are typically configured using the
Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) standards. These two provide
common, device-independent ways to boot and configure computer
hardware. They are also common in the x86 PC world.

  <para>
    Arm64/AArch64/ARMv8 hardware became available quite late in the
    &debian; &releasename-cap; release cycle so not many platforms had
    support merged in the mainline kernel version by the time of this
    release; this is the main requirement to have &d-i; working on
    them. The following platforms are known to be supported by
    &debian;/arm64 in this release. There is only one kernel image,
    which supports all the listed platforms.

	    The APM Mustang was the first Linux-capable ARMv8 system
	    available. It uses the X-gene SoC, which has since also
	    been used in other machines. It is an 8-core CPU, with
	    ethernet, USB and serial. A common form-factor looks just
	    like a desktop PC box, but many other versions are
	    expected in the future. Most of the hardware is supported
	    in the mainline kernel, but at this point USB support is
	    lacking in the &releasename-cap; kernel.

    When using &d-i; on non-UEFI systems, you may have to manually
    make the system bootable at the end of the installation, e.g. by
    running the required commands in a shell started from within
    &d-i;. flash-kernel knows how to set up an X-Gene system booting
    with U-Boot.

    The multiplatform support in the arm64 Linux kernel may also allow
    running &d-i; on arm64 systems not explicitly listed above. So
    long as the kernel used by &d-i; has support for the target
    system's components, and a device-tree file for that target is
    available, a new target system may work just fine.  In these
    cases, the installer can usually provide a working installation,
    and so long as UEFI is in use, it should be able to make the
    system bootable as well. If UEFI is not used you may also need to
    perform some manual configuration steps to make the system
    bootable.

            System support for Allwinner sunXi-based devices is
            limited to drivers and device-tree information available
            in the mainline Linux kernel. Vendor-specific kernel
            trees (such as the Allwinner SDK kernels) and the
            android-derived linux-sunxi.org kernel 3.4 series are not
            supported by &debian;.
          </para> 
          <para>
            The mainline Linux kernel generally supports serial
            console, ethernet, SATA, USB and MMC/SD-cards on
            Allwinner A10, A10s/A13, A20, A23/A33 and A31/A31s SoCs. 
            The level of support for local display (HDMI/VGA/LCD) and
            audio hardware varies between individual systems.  For
            most systems, the kernel doesn't have native graphics
            drivers but instead uses the <quote>simplefb</quote>
            infrastructure in which the bootloader initializes the
            display and the kernel just re-uses the pre-initialized
            framebuffer. This generally works reasonably well,
            although it results in certain limitations (the display
            resolution cannot be changed on the fly and display
            powermanagement is not possible).
          </para>
          <para>
            Onboard flash memory intended to be used as a mass
            storage device generally exists in two basic variants on
            sunXi-based systems: raw NAND flash and eMMC flash.  Most
            older sunXi-based boards with onboard flash storage use
            raw NAND flash for which support is not generally
            available in the mainline kernel and therefore also not
            in Debian.  A number of newer systems use eMMC flash
            instead of raw NAND flash.  An eMMC flash chip basically
            appears as a fast, non-removable SD card and is supported
            in the same way as a regular SD card.

            The installer includes basic support for a number of
            sunXi-based systems not listed above, but it is largely

            have access to the corresponding hardware.  No pre-built

            systems.  Development boards with such limited support

            In addition to the SoCs and systems listed above, the
            installer has very limited support for the Allwinner H3
            SoC and a number of boards based on it.  Mainline kernel
            support for the H3 is still largely work in progress at
            the time of the Debian 9 release freeze, so the installer
            only supports serial console, MMC/SD and the USB host
            controller on H3-based systems.  There is no driver for
            the on-board ethernet port of the H3 yet, so networking
            is only possible with a USB ethernet adaptor or a USB
            wifi dongle.  Systems based on the H3 for which such very
