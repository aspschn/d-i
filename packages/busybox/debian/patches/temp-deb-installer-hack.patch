Subject: Temporary hack re-enable invalid variable names
From: Chris Boot <bootc@debian.org>
Forwarded: not-needed

Upstream busybox commit b6838b520 ("ash: [VAR] Sanitise environment
variable names on entry") breaks assumptions used by debian-installer's
preseed system. This results in settings passed to the installer on the
kernel command-line getting stripped out if they contain invalid
characters in the variable name, such as '/', which is actually very
common in this use case.

This is not a long term fix for this problem: a different approach is
needed to parse the values from the kernel command-line, but we don't
want to be responsible for holding up the debian-installer alpha
release any longer than it has already.
