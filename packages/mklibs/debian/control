Package: mklibs
Architecture: all
Depends: python (>= 2.4), binutils, gcc, dpkg-dev, mklibs-copy (>= ${source:Version}), ${python:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}

Description: Shared library reduction script
 mklibs produces cut-down shared libraries that contain only the
 routines required by a particular set of executables.  This is
 useful when building closed systems where disk space is at a premium,
 such as the Debian installer.

Package: mklibs-copy
Architecture: any
Depends: python (>= 2.4), dpkg-dev, ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Shared library reduction script
 mklibs-copy produces a minimal set of shared libraries that contain
 only the libs which are required by a particular set of executables.
